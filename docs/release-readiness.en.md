# Release Readiness

[中文](release-readiness.md) | [English](release-readiness.en.md)

Current package version: `3.5.1`. This release keeps the sidecar-only mainline and builds on the V3.5.0 Feishu card button interaction loop with fixes for streaming update ordering/backlog, queued follow-up native text spillover, Feishu JSON 2.0 button rendering, and `.env` credential loading during manual sidecar restarts.

## Ready

- Hermes `v2026.4.23+` detection and fail-closed installation.
- Minimal Hermes hook, backup, manifest, restore, and uninstall.
- Sidecar `/events`, `/health`, and process `start/status/stop`.
- Feishu CardKit HTTP client, covered by mock Feishu server and real Feishu test app for tenant token, send, and update flows.
- Manual `smoke-feishu-card` command.
- E2E preview artifacts and generator.
- Real long-card stress test: one Feishu card updated to 16k Chinese characters.
- Real Hermes `v2026.4.23` `restore -> install` loop verification.
- Hermes `0.13.0+` / `0.14.0` / `v2026.5.16+` use the `gateway_run_013_plus` hook strategy, while older `v2026.4.x` keeps `legacy_gateway_run`.
- Feishu card button interactions are covered through local mock acceptance for `interaction.requested`, `/card/actions`, and `/interactions/{interaction_id}`.
- Long Markdown tables and fenced code blocks over `MAIN_CONTENT_CHUNK_CHARS` are split as complete repeated structures to avoid raw Markdown rendering.
- Thinking/interim assistant messages use complete `append_block` chunks to avoid delta accumulation truncation or missing text.
- Runtime event sends, sidecar updates, and terminal PATCH calls are ordered/coalesced for the same message id.
- `load_config()` reads a `.env` file next to the selected config file while preserving real process environment variables as the highest-precedence source.
- GitHub Actions Python 3.9 / 3.12 test matrix for PRs and pushes.

## Required Pre-release Checks

```bash
python3 -m pytest -q
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli doctor --config config.yaml.example --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli install --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
python3 -m hermes_feishu_card.cli restore --hermes-dir ~/.hermes/hermes-agent --yes
```

Real Feishu integration must use local config or environment variables for `FEISHU_APP_ID` and `FEISHU_APP_SECRET`. Do not commit App Secret, tenant token, real chat_id, or sensitive screenshots. Public screenshots must be checked for secrets and private conversation content before being added to the repository.

## Current Boundaries

Automated tests do not access real Feishu and do not start a real Hermes Gateway. Real integration remains a local/manual acceptance flow. After successful testing, record only redacted results; never commit credentials, real chat_id, or sensitive screenshots.
